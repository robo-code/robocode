This is way how to test your robots with JUnit and Robocode.

1) Look at robocode/testing/sample/TestWallBehavior.java 
  - it's behavioral integration test, to proove that samples.Wall robot will visit all 4 corners of battlefield
  - it's inherited from robocode.control.testing.RobotTestBed, which is part of robocode.testing extension
  
2) RobotTestBed - base class for tests
  - provides setup of Robocode engine itself
  - expects you to set Java system property robocode.home to path to your robocode installation. For example C:\Robocode
  - supports setup of battle by overriding various virtual methods, among others
    - getRobotNames() - allows you to specify coma separated list of robos for battle
    - getNumRounds() - allows you to specify number of rounds for the battle
    - for more see robocode/testing/javadoc/index.html
  - implements IBattleListener interface of robocode and it's notified about battle events
    - override onTurnEnded() method to be invoked after each turn, with snapshot of current battlefield
    - override onBattleCompleted() method to be invoked after battle, with battle resutls and scores
    - for more see robocode/testing/javadoc/index.html and robocode/javadoc/index.html
    
3) Build the unit test by starting robocode\testing\compile.cmd or do it in your IDE

4) Run the test with JUnit by starting robocode\testing\test.cmd or do it in your IDE
   - note that we pass -Drobocode.home Java property
   
5) watch the test result
