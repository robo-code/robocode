 *     - Optimized for Java 5
 *     - Updated Javadocs
 *     - Removed try-catch(ClassCastException) from compareTo()
 *     - Changed compareTo() to first and foremost compare the events based on
 *       their evnt times, and secondly to compare the priorities if the event
 *       times are equals. Previously, the priorities were compared first, and
 *       secondly the evnt times if the priorities were equal.
 *       This change was made to sort the evnt queues of the robots in
 *       chronological so that the older events are listed before newer events
