    /**
     * Interactive - a sample robot by Flemming N. Larsen.
     * <p/>
     * This is a robot that is controlled using the arrow keys and mouse only.
     * <p/>
     * Keys:
     * - Arrow up:    Move forward
     * - Arrow down:  Move backward
     * - Arrow right: Turn right
     * - Arrow left:  Turn left
     * Mouse:
     * - Moving:      Moves the aim, which the gun will follow
     * - Wheel up:    Move forward
     * - Wheel down:  Move backward
     * - Button 1:    Fire a bullet with power = 1
     * - Button 2:    Fire a bullet with power = 2
     * - Button 3:    Fire a bullet with power = 3
     * <p/>
     * The bullet color depends on the Fire power:
     * - Power = 1:   Yellow
     * - Power = 2:   Orange
     * - Power = 3:   Red
     * <p/>
     * Note that the robot will continue firing as long as the mouse button is
     * pressed down.
     * <p/>
     * By enabling the "Paint" button on the robot console window for this robot,
     * a cross hair will be painted for the robots current aim (controlled by the
     * mouse).
