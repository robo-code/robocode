# User property. It's highly recommendable that you change this to use your name
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# USER      The user name used when uploading the results to the RoboRumble
#           server. Hence, you should replace 'Put_Your_Name_Here' with your
#           name, which could be the initials you use for your robot(s).

# Exclude filter used for excluding participants. Use with care!
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXCLUDE   A comma separated list of all the participants you want to exclude
#           from the competition. Excluded participants will not be downloaded
#           or take part in battles. This way you can exclude participants that
#           cannot be downloaded due to web servers that are down or hanging,
#           the repository is down, robots/teams that crashes for some reason or
#           cause other trouble. 
#
#           You can use the filename wildcards * and ? in the filter. Example:
#
#           EXCLUDE=xyz.*v1.?, *Nano*

# Properties to control the way battles are run 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# RUNONLY   If left black or set to GENERAL, a new battle file is created where
#           robots from the participants file are paired at random. The number
#           of robot pairs will match number of battles defined the NUMBATTLES
#           property. 
#
#           If set to SERVER (recommended), a new battle file is created which
#           will first of all contain priority battles for robots that that has
#           priority over other robots until they have fought a specific number
#           of battles specified by the BATTLESPERBOT property. The number of
#           battles fought by the individual robots are extracted from the
#           rating files, which are downloaded from the server if the DOWNLOAD
#           property is set to YES. When no more priority battles are left,
#           robots from the participants file are paired at random similar to
#           GENERAL.
#
# BATTLESPERBOT
#           The number of battles a robot has to fight before it will no longer
#           have priority over other robots in battles. Prioritizing a robot
#           makes its rating more reliable faster as its number of fought
#           battles increases faster than when it is not prioritized.
#
# PRIORITYBATTLESFILE
#           The priority battles file that is generated automatically by the
#           rumble when the RUNONLY property is set to SERVER.
