/**
 * This nasty robot tries to interrupt the thread of each opponent robot that it scans.
 * It enumerates the threads recursively of thread group that is a parent of its own
 * thread group to find out, which threads that are active. These threads are all robot
 * threads.
 * 
 * This robot is inspired by the hacker.Destroyer 1.3, which proved a security breach in
 * Robocode 1.7.2.1 Beta. The security breach was reported with:
 * Bug [3021140] Possible for robot to kill other robot threads.
 *
 * The security manager of Robocode must make sure that unsafe (robot) threads cannot
 * access thread groups other than its own thread group within checkAccess(Thread).
