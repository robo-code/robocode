The Robocode Control API is used for controlling the Robocode
application from another external application. Basically, it is possible
to run battles between selected robots and retrieve the results. However,
it is also possible to get detailed information as snapshots during the
battles regarding e.g. the positions and headings of the individual robots
and bullets at a specific time during a battle.
<p>
The main entry class is the Robocode.Control.RobocodeEngine class, which
must be instantiated by the application controlling Robocode. With the
RobocodeEngine, a battle specification must be provided in order to run a
battle. The battle specification specify the size of the battlefield, and
which rules that must be used. In addition, the participant robots must be
selected, which must exist in the robot directory of Robocode in
advantage.

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
Here is a simple application that runs a battle in Robocode for 5 rounds
on the default battlefield of 800x600 pixels. The robots selected for the
battle are sample.RamFire and sample.Corners.
