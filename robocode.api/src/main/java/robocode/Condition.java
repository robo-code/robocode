/**
 * Condition is used to define custom  {@link AdvancedRobot#waitFor(Condition)
 * waitFor(Condition)} and custom events for an {@link AdvancedRobot}. The code
 * below is taken from the sample robot named {@code sample.Target}. See the
 * {@code sample/Target.java} for details.
 * <pre>
 *   addCustomEvent(
 *       new Condition("triggerhit") {
 *           public boolean test() {
 *               return (getEnergy() <= trigger);
 *           };
 *       }
 *   );
 * </pre>
 * You should note that by extending Condition this way, you are actually
 * creating an inner class -- so if you distribute your robot, there will be
 * multiple class files. (i.e. {@code Target$1.class})
