Version 1.2.2 Beta
(12/05/2006)
  -- Added TPS slider to the toolbar on the battle window so the TPS can be changed quickly

Version 1.2.1A
(11/26/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- Hitting wall with an exact angle of 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees caused a robot to
     disappear from the battlefield (could be seen with the sample robots Corner and Wall)
  -- The check for wall collision did not work properly in some situations due to rounding
     problems with float vs double precision
  -- These bugs were found and corrected by Titus Chen

Version 1.2.1
(11/24/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- The turnGun(double) method returned before the gun rotation had returned
  -- Teleportation when hitting wall and abs(sin(heading)) > 0.00001 or
     abs(cos(heading)) > 0.00001
  -- HitRobotEvent.isMyFault() returned false despite the fact that the robot was moving
     toward the robot it collided with. This was the case when distanceRemaining == 0
     even though this could occur on purpose if the move was set to distanceRemaining
  -- Bad bullet collision detection algorithm. This has been replaced with Paul Bourke's
     2D line intersection algorithm

Version 1.2
(11/05/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- Fixed a lot of bugs that was introduced with the 1.1.4 versions and version 1.1.5
  -- Fixed "Robot hangs" when running long battles, which was not really fixed in 1.1.5
  -- Some text fields in e.g. the "New Battle" were not tall enough to show their content
     on for e.g. Gnome/Linux.
o The NOSECURITY option has been extended so it is now possible to access 3rd party jar files
  -- If you want to access other jars in your robot you'll have to disable the security in
     Robocode by setting the NOSECURITY option to true, i.e. adding -DNOSECURITY=true in
     robocode.bat (under Windows) or robocode.sh (under Mac and Linux)
  -- You'll also have to add the jar file to your CLASSPATH or put it into the /lib/ext folder
     of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE), if adding it to the CLASSPATH does not work
o Results can now be saved in the Comma Separated Value (CSV) File Format
  -- A "Save" button has been added to the battle results dialog
o The rank and name of the robots in the battle results dialog and in ranking panel has been
  splitted up into two independent colums, i.e "Rank" and "Name"
  -- This was necessary in order to save the rank and name independently in a file
o The default browser under Windows is now used when browsing e.g. the Online Help
  -- The browser.bat file has been removed as there is no need for it anymore

Version 1.1.5
(10/22/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- Fixed BulletHitBulletEvents, where half of them refered to the wrong bullet
  -- The the battle results were not always ranked correctly
o The Ranking Panel total score is now updated on the fly

Version 1.1.4B
(10/19/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- The getName() on ScannedRobotEvent returned null
  -- Fixed "Robot hangs" pausing the game
  -- Fixed the robocode.sh (Unix) file which contained a ^M (Microsoft DOS/Windows
     character), which caused this file to be unusable for starting Robocode
  -- Updated the Common Public License to the original version

Version 1.1.4A
(10/15/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- The sounds were cut off after first round
  -- The Ranking Panel position and size was not saved in the window.properties file
  -- ConcurrentModificationException fixed in the robot event queue
  -- Periodic NullPointerException removed from battle view

Version 1.1.4
(10/14/2006)
o Bugfixes
  -- The BattleView was not updated on the primary monitor display on a dual monitor system
  -- Sounds: When enabling sounds on-the-fly when it was originally disabled, Robocode
     crashed/halted due to a NullPointerException
  -- Runtime exception (NullPointerException) when opening a battle the first time when a new
     version of Robocode the first time
  -- Editor: When inserting text by copy'n'paste or search'n'replace into the Editor,
     extra tabs were sometimes added
o Ranking Panel added to the Options menu
  -- The contributor of this feature is Luis Crespo (email: lcrespom at gmail.com)
  -- This panel shows the current robot rankings during battles
o Single-step debugging
  -- The contributor of this feature is Luis Crespo (email: lcrespom at gmail.com)
  -- The "Pause" button has been extended into "Pause/Debug", and a "Next Turn" button
     is available to perform one turn at a time, which is vital for single-step debugging
o Rules class added containing helper methods and constants for Robocode rules
o Common Options has been added
  -- Currently contains "Show results when battle(s) ends", which enable/disable showing
     the results dialog when the battle(s) ends
o A lot of internal optimizations of Robocode has been made to speed up the game
o Robocode icons has been updated

Version 1.1.3
The "Java 5 and Sound" release
(9/20/2006)
-------------
o Bugfixes
  -- Wrong 1st place scores for robots, which got 1 point for winning and also 1 point for the
     death of an enemy robot, and hence got 2 points instead of just 1 point for the 1st place
o The minimum requirement for Robocode is now Java 5 (1.5.0)
  -- You must have at least a JRE 5.0 (1.5.0) or JDK 5.0.
  -- Robocode has also been tested with the upcomming Java 6 (1.6.0) where it seems to run
     just fine
o Sounds have been added to Robocode along with Sound Options
  -- The contributor of the Sound engine is Luis Crespo (email: lcrespom at gmail.com)
  -- You are able to change between available mixers (on your system)
  -- Panning is supported, so that explosions in e.g. the left side of the screen is louder
     in the left speaker
  -- Volume is supported, so that e.g. a bullet with more power makes more noise
  -- Note: Some mixers performs better, but might not support volume and/or panning
o A new command line option, -nosound, has been added in order to turn off sound support
  -- This feature should prove useful on systems without sound support
o Improved the notification about new available Robocode versions
  -- Now Robocode will only give a notification about a new available version if the version
     number is greater than the version retrieved from the robocode.jar file
  -- The check interval has been changed from 10 days into 5 days
o New setColor methods:
  -- The setColors(bodyColor, gunColor, radarColor) has been reintroduced
  -- The setColors(bodyColor, gunColor, radarColor, bulletColor, scanColor) has been added
  -- The setAllColor(color) has been added
o The Robocode logo on the splash screen and battle view is now rendered using Java2D
o The layout of the Developer Options was improved a bit

Version 1.1.2
(8/20/2006)
The "Robocode is now TPS centric instead of FPS centric" release
-------------
o Bugfixes
  -- The buildJikes.sh contained the ^M (DOS return-carrige characters), which do not belong
     in a Unix/Linux file  ;-)
  -- The radar color was sometimes painted with too much lumination (white)
o Robocode is no longer FPS (Frames Per Second) centric, meaning that 1 turn (time unit) = 1 frame
  -- Robocode is now TPS (Turns Per Second) centric, meaning that 1 turn is not necessarily equal
     to 1 frame anymore. You specify how many turns you want to compute every second (desired TPS),
     and Robocode will render as many frames as possible depending on the TPS. If the TPS is
     higher than the FPS, some turns are not rendered. However, this does not mean that turns are
     skipped
  -- The higher TPS, the lower the FPS will get
  -- The better graphics hardware acceleration the higher TPS and FPS
  -- Replaced the -fps (Frames Per Second) command line option with the -tps (Turns Per Second)
  -- Now there is an option to display both the TPS and FPS in the titlebar in the View Options
o Added Rendering Options to the Preferences
  -- It now possible to change the settings for Antialiasing, Text Antialiasing, Rendering Method,
     and number of rendering buffers
o Explosions are no longer pre-scaled in 6 fixed sizes, but instead scaled real-time using Java2D
  -- The explosion sizes are now more precise depending on bullet damage, and the memory usage for
     the explosions has been brought down by not using pre-scaled explosion images
  -- This fixed the painting of explosions on the iMac, where explosions were painted as filled
     circles with version 1.1 and 1.1.1
o Bullets are now painted as filled energy balls with a size that depends on the bullet energy
  -- The size (circle area) is calculated so that:
  -- A bullet with power = 0.1 (minimum power) uses 1 pixel
  -- A bullet with power = 3 (maximum power) uses 30 pixels
  -- In addition, explosions when a bullet hits a robot or another bullet are also depending on
     the bullet energy
o Added the option "Visible Explosions" in the View Options to the Preferences
  -- This option makes it possible to enable and disable the painting of explosions
o The setColors() method is now deprecated
  -- Replaced by setBodyColor(), setRadarColor(), and setScanColor()
o Two new methods has been added:
  -- setBulletColor() for changing the bullet color, and
  -- setScanColor() for changing the scan color (used for drawing scan arcs)
o All sample robots has been updated
  -- Deprecated methods are replaced by current methods
  -- Colors has been added to each robot, except for MyFirstRobot, which should be kept as simple
     as possible
o Restart button has been added in order to restart a battle
o No graphical components are loaded anymore when Robocode is run from the command line with
  the -nodisplay option
  -- This feature has been added in order to run Robocode on Unix-like systems that don't have
     X installed on them
o Added Browse button in the Development Options
o Changed some keyboard mnemonics in the View Options in the Preferences

Version 1.1.1
(7/6/2006)
-------------
o Bugfixes
  -- The CPU speed detection has been changed to accept 50 times as many clock cycles than with
     with v1.0.7. Robots than ran fine under v1.0.6 were skipping turns like crazy under v1.0.7
  -- Robot text-output error has been fixed according to the solution provided by Matt
     (msj(at)sysmatrix(dot)net)
  -- The window position and sizes were not loaded properly from the windows.properties file
  -- The state of the "View option" was not loaded correctly, and hence always set to enabled
     everytime Robocode was restarted
  -- updateMovement() that checked for "distanceRemaining > 1" instead of "distanceRemaining > 0"
     when slowing down
  -- The radar was not colored correctly due to a bug in the coloring filter
  -- The Robocode editor's window menu did not remove closed windows properly when muliple windows
     were opened in the editor
  -- Various part of Robocode did not work properly if installed into a folder containing spaces,
     e.g. compiling and viewing the API documentation did not work
  -- Installing and compiling under Mac 10.3.9 was fixed.
o Added 1200x1200 battle field size as one of the standard sizes, and set the size step to 100.
  -- This feature was added to accommodate RoboRumble@Home
o The battle window is no longer reset every time a new battle is started and the window size and
  position is saved into the windows.properties file
o The robot colors are now painted using a true HSL color model
  -- The change to use the HSL color model fixed the bug regarding none or wrong coloring.
  -- Also, the lumination of the robot colors has been changed
o Added a checkbox to enable Robocode SG painting in the robot console
  -- The "Debug paint" button in the robot console has been renamed to "Paint"
  -- The "Paint" button enables painting in general, and by trickering "Robocode SG", the robot
     (debug) painting will be rendered as Robocode SG does it
o Added the "-Xmx512M" option to the batch files extending the max. memory heap size to 512 MB
o Added the "-Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false" which fixes some SecurityException issues on robots
  that read from files, and also fixed the installing and compiling problem under Mac 10.3.9

Version 1.1
(6/14/2006)
The "Continuation" release

The "TEAMS" release
------------
o Introducing:  Teams!
  -- See sampleteam.MyFirstTeam for an example
  -- Teams may consist of 2 to 10 robots
  -- To use teams, first create one or more TeamRobots, then create a Team.
  -- TeamRobots will not show up in the New Battle dialog by default.
     You can change this behavior in Options->Preferences.
  -- To create a team, select Robot->Team->Create Team.
  -- You can add regular robots to a team,
     but they will not be able to communicate.
  -- The *first* robot you add to a team becomes the "team leader".
     Team leaders start with 200 energy. (They are superheroes)
	 When team leaders die, all other members of the team lose 30 energy.
     Protect your leader!
  -- Team scoring is cumulative, but similar to normal scoring:
     Teams receive 50 points for each surviving team member every time an enemy dies.
     Teams receive 10 * numEnemies points for each surviving teammate upon winning.
     Damage bonuses are for all damage dealt by that team
     Firsts, Seconds, Thirds are based on last surviving team member
  -- Teammates can damage each other
  -- Teams can be packaged like regular robots
  -- Teammates without a version will receive the team version
     [enclosed in square brackets]
  -- Team messages are limited to 32K per message.
o Introducing:  Droids
  -- Droids are robots without radar or scanning ability
  -- simply add "implements Droid" to a TeamRobot to create a droid.
  -- Droids start with 120 energy (due to weight savings on the radar)
  -- Droids do not show up in the New Battle dialog by default.
     You can change this behavior in Options->Preferences.
  -- The API is unchanged, but scanning will not work.
  -- See sampleteam.MyFirstDroid for an example
o Added new class:  TeamRobot
  -- See Javadocs for details.
  -- Adds messaging capability to robots
o Added new class:  MessageEvent

  -- Only works in the first round
  -- Only the first 16 robots in a battle will get their requested colors
o Robots may now extend or use classes that are not in their package
  -- This allows for utility classes, when they are in the robots tree
  -- If you do not wish others to extend your robot, declare your robot class final
  -- If you do not with others to use classes from your package, do not declare them public
  -- All referenced classes will be packaged with the robot packager
o Robots in the robotcache directory that do not have a .properties file will not
  show up in the robot selection dialog (done in order to support extended robots, above)
o You may now delete files in your data directory

Version 0.98
(11/27/2001)
The "It's starting to feel real" release
------------
o Added setColors(Color robotColor, Color gunColor, Color radarColor) to Robot
  -- By default, robots are the default blue
  -- Call this in your run method (no more than once per round) to set your robot's colors
  -- Accepts any System default colors, i.e. Color.red
o Robots are now instantiated each round.
  -- You no longer need to re-initialize all your variables at the beginning of run()
  -- ** Only static variables are persistent across rounds **
o Graphics optimizations
  -- no more rotating images at the start of each battle
  -- far more memory efficient
o New model for CPU time.
  -- Robocode now uses the Linpack benchmark
     (http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/linpackjava/
  -- Used to determine how much time each robot is allowed for processing
o Threading changes
  -- Robocode is now threadsafe (as far as I know, anyway)
  -- Robot threads execute sequentially
  -- No more "busy wait" enhances performance, especially on large battles
o Minimized optimizations
  -- When minimized, Robocode will not do any drawing
  -- FPS can really crank up (when set in options-preferences)
o Minor graphic changes (The gun is slightly further forward)
o New class hierarchy, in order to clean up the javadocs
  -- added _Robot and _AdvancedRobot
  -- These hold deprecated methods and system-related things
  -- added _AdvancedRadiansRobot to clean up the AdvancedRobot docs
  -- You should still extend either Robot or AdvancedRobot
o Battles may now consist of 1-256 robots
  -- A warning confirmation will appear for > 24 robots
  -- A confirmation will appear for 1 robot
o Robots will now appear as they are loaded
  -- So large battles won't appear "hung"
o Consoles persist between battles (although they are cleared)
o Console threading is more efficient
o Console scrolling is crisper (bug fixed)
o Console now has an unlimited size, once opened.
  -- there is an 8K circular buffer before it is opened.
o setInterruptible() moved to AdvancedRobot
  -- deprecated version in Robot does nothing
  -- Note: Balancing of the "Robot" class still needs work.
o skipping turns may happen more often, but is not as big a deal as it used to be.
  -- with the exception of your first turn
  -- You will only lose events if you skip 2 in a row
  -- You will not be stopped unless you skip 60 turns in a row.
  -- skipped turns can be caused by loading classes from disk,
     writing files, etc.  If this becomes a problem, I will preload
	 all classes.
o Fixed bug with compiler when filename has a space
o Fixed bug with getting BulletMissed and BulletHit events for same bullet
o Fixed bug with editor locking up reading some files
o Another round of major code organization
o Again, probably more minor items that I already forgot about :)
o (Later additions... such as:)
  -- Invalid insert bug in editor
  -- Copy/Paste from console

Version 0.97.4
(11/18/2001)
The "finally, a single installer!" release
--------------
o Completely reworked install process.
o There is no longer a setup.exe installer.

  -- you may use javac if you prefer, and you have it.
o API docs now link to the Java API
o Fixed bug:  Editor did not close files after saving
o Fixed bug:  Unable to deselect "display robot names"
o Fixed bug:  Shared static vars between instances of the same robot
o Fixed a few graphics glitches
o Minor doc updates

Version 0.97.3
(11/5/2001)
The "hourly release" release :)
--------------
o Fixed nullpointer exception when loading robots with no package
o Added robocode.robot.filesystem.quota property to robocode.properties
  -- This is a temporary solution, which sets the default filesystem quota for robots
  -- example:  robocode.robot.filesystem.quota=200000
     for 200k.
o Fixed bug in editor that caused it to suggest an unreasonable filename.
	 
Version 0.97.2
(11/4/2001)
--------------
o Fixed bug that caused some robots to be stopped by the game
o Battles/Rounds start faster (back to 0.96.2 speed)
o More lenient on CPU use
  -- You have roughly 4 whole seconds before your first move
  -- You have roughly 50 + (1000 / fps) milliseconds to process each frame
  -- This is more than twice what the entire game itself gets. :)
  -- Failure to take action in that amount of time results in a SkippedTurnEvent
  -- You will be removed from the round if you skip 30 turns in a round
  -- Un-deprecated onSkippedTurn and SkippedTurnEvent
  -- No reasonable robot should ever receive a SkippedTurnEvent...
     but now it's there just in case.

Version 0.97.1
(11/3/2001)
--------------
o Abstract classes now work properly in the selection dialog and robot database
o Fixed a few Javadoc bugs
o Fixed pause/resume bug
o Javadocs have deprecated calls again

Version 0.97
(11/2/2001)
The "painful but worth it" release
--------------
o I probably missed a few things in this list. :)
o Introducing the Robot Packager
  -- Select your robot, type in a few details, and let it figure out the rest
  -- Saves details in  a .properties file (see details below)
  -- Builds a .jar for you
  -- Save this .jar in your robots directory (not a subdirectory, for now)
  -- You may distribute this jar as a standalone robot.
o .properties files
  -- Not required unless you are packaging your robot
  -- Built automatically by the packager
  -- Includes:  
        Robot version
		Short description
		Optional author name
		Optional webpage
		Robocode version
		Flag for source included
o .jar files, and the robotcache
  -- Simply put a robot .jar file in your robots directory
  -- It will be extracted to the "robotcache"
  -- Jar filename is the unique key for the robotcache
  -- Do not edit files in the robotcache, they may be overwritten.
     Copy them to your robots directory if you like.
	 This will be a feature in a future version of Robocode.
o Robot Database
  -- Built and maintained for you
  -- Allows Robocode to remember which .class files are robots, and which not
  -- Press F5 in the robot selection dialog to refresh the database.
o Robot Selection dialog
  -- Divided up into packages
  -- Shows robot details (from .properties) if they exist.
o .html files
  -- Create a .html file if you like... see sample.SittingDuck
  -- Linked from robot selection dialog
o Major scoring changes
  -- 50 points every time an enemy dies while you are alive
  -- (10 * numOthers) points if you are the sole survivor
  -- 1 point for each point of damage you do with bullets
  -- 2 points for each point of damage you do by ramming (see Ramming changes, below)
  -- bonus .2 * damage done to a specific enemy, if you kill that robot, or
  -- bonus .3 * damage done to a specific enemy, if you kill by ramming
o Ramming changes:
  -- Damage increased (from .4 to .6)
  -- Only generates score if you are moving toward the enemy
  -- If you are ramming, and run out of energy, you will now be disabled instead of killed
o "Life" replaced with "Energy"
  -- A more sensible name
  -- All getLife() calls deprecated and replaced with getEnergy()
o Added getEnergy() to HitRobotEvent (I can't believe it wasn't there before!)
o Only Robots and AdvancedRobots will show in the New Battle dialog.
  -- fixes known bug listed below at the end of 0.96 changes.
o Custom events are now be cleared at the start of each round
  -- However, since many robots rely on them still existing,
     Robocode will currently re-add any custom events
	 that were created at the beginning of the first round,
	 for all remaining rounds.  This is a temporary solution for
	 backwards compatibility, and will cause a warning message in your console.
o You may now print to System.out
  -- Will automatically redirect output to your console
o Robot Editor now supports creating normal Java files
o Added line number display to Robot Editor
o MoveCompleteCondition bug fixed.
o getTurnRemaining(), getGunTurnRemaining(), getRadarTurnRemaining() now return degrees
o getTurnRemainingRadians(), getGunTurnRemainingRadians(), getRadarTurnRemainingRadians() added.
o Added setAdjustRadarForRobotTurn(boolean)
  -- by default, set to the value of setAdjustRadarForGunTurn for backwards compatibility
o Windows now remember their last position
  -- This is based on the preferred size of the window, so
     that different battlefield sizes may have different
	 window position and sizes.
  -- This is stored in the file "window.properties" which you can
     safely delete to reset.
o Added "Default Window Size" to Options menu
  -- Resizes the window to optimal (even better than before)
o Command-line parameters to run a battle
  -- robocode -battle battles\sample.battle -results out.txt -fps 250 -minimize
  -- Results will go to System.out if you do not specify a results file
  -- All other Robocode output goes to System.err
o "Activity" is now defined as loss of 10 energy in the battle
  -- Inactivity Time is now the number of frames in which 10 energy must be lost
  -- This does not include loss due to inactivity itself, or hitting walls
  -- Prevents robots stopping the inactivity timer by calling fire(.1) every 15 seconds.
o Compiler uses -g option for debugging.
  -- This *may* help those users trying to use advanced debuggers.
o Much improved "waiting for robots to start"
o More lenient on "robot has not performed any actions"
o Various javadoc fixes
o Minor updates to template files

Version 0.96.2
(10/9/2001)
--------------
o Fixed bug in movement that allowed robots to exceed maxVelocity

Version 0.96.1
--------------
o Added automatic version checking
o Added getVelocity() to Robot
o Fixed minor bug in editor (caused the "do" in "doNothing" to highlight)
o WinException and DeathException now extend Error instead of RuntimeException.
  -- So you won't catch them by mistake with catch (Exception e)
  -- You still don't want to catch them, or you'll get no score.\
o fixed minor api doc bugs
o Added a warning when you are calling the setXXX methods too many times (300)
  -- has no effect on whether the game stops you or not,
     it simply helps to explain why.
  before taking an action
o Replaced BrowserControl with BrowserLauncher, from http://www.stanford.edu/~ejalbert/software/BrowserLauncher
  -- Should work on more systems
o Synchronized tick()
  -- Two threads cannot take action at the same time.
  -- This entire area needs work
o FPS no longer displayed when Swing doublebuffering is on
o Added getHeadingRadians() to Bullet.
o Fixed getHeading() in Bullet to return degrees.

Version 0.96
(10/5/2001)
The "Robocode is now my life" release
------------
o Renamed "Battles" to "Rounds" -- a single battle consists of multiple rounds.
o Commented and updated all sample robots
o All sample robots are now in package "sample"
o If the old samples exist, Robocode will ask you if it may delete them, when you first run it.
o Only Target, Crazy, Spinbot are still AdvancedRobots
 -- Target must be for the custom event
 -- Crazy and Spinbot call setTurn methods.
o SittingDuck is now an AdvancedRobot
 -- SittingDuck writes to the filesystem.
o Help system now uses system browser.  Hopefully.  Let me know of any issues.
o API Help menu item copied to RobocodeEditor, and uses the local copy.
o Robots may now use,extend,or inherit external classes, as long as they are in the same root package.
  -- You must be in a package to use this feature
o Added call: getDataDirectory() to AdvancedRobot -- returns java.io.File representing your data directory.
o Added call: getDataFile(String filename) to AdvancedRobot -- returns java.io.File representing a file in your data directory.
o AdvancedRobots may now read files that are in the same directory (or subdirectory) as their root package.
  -- It is recommended that you only read from your data directory
  -- You may not read another robot's data directory
  -- If you extend another robot, and it calls getDataDirectory, it will get YOUR data directory.
  -- If you extend another robot, and manually try to read it's data directory, it will fail.
o Added classes: RobocodeFileOutputStream and RobocodeFileWriter
o AdvancedRobots may now write files to their data directory
  -- You must use RobocodeFileOutputStream or RobocodeFileWriter
  -- Any other output stream will fail
  -- You may wrapper them with other outputstreams
  -- Example: PrintStream out1 = new PrintStream(new RobocodeFileOutputStream(getDataFile("my.dat")));
  -- There is a quota of 100K.
o Fixed scoring bug (as exhibited by rk.Rotator)
o Fixed threads stuck in wait condition when new battle selected
o Fixed threads stuck in onWin or onDeath events
o Fixed threads not taking action
o Fixed leftover threads
o Fixed a half dozen other thread issues
o Limited # of worker threads a robot may have to 5 
o Limited print/println calls to out, to 100 per turn.
o Robots now run in their own ThreadGroup.  (You can no longer can see other robot's threads)
o Robots now have their own Classloader.  (static variable "messages" will no longer work)
o Fixed null pointer exception in RobocodeOutputStream
o WinEvents or DeathEvents will now be the only thing in the event queue.
o Reworked event handler system, should be more robust
o Tweaked event priorities.  New default priorities are:
 *	ScannedRobotEvent: 		10
 *	HitRobotEvent:     		20
 *	HitWallEvent:      		30
 *	HitByBulletEvent:  		40
 *	BulletHitEvent:    		50
 *  BulletHitBulletEvent: 	50
 *	BulletMissedEvent: 		60
 *	RobotDeathEvent:   		70
 *	CustomEvent:       		80
 *	WinEvent:          		100 (cannot be modified)
 *	DeathEvent:        		100 (cannot be modified)
o Valid priorities are 0 to 99 (100 is reserved)
o Added new method "setInterruptible(boolean)" to Robot
  -- Can only be used while handling an event
  -- Always resets to false when the event ends
  -- Causes event handler to restart from the top, if
     the same event (or another event of the same priority)
	 is generated while in the event handler following this call.
  -- This will only happen if you take an action inside an event handler,
     that causes the same event handler to be called.
  -- This makes it possible for Robots to turn and move like AdvancedRobots...
  -- This has no effect on events of higher priority
o Calling scan() inside of onScannedRobot() can now restart onScannedRobot
     -- internally calls setInterruptible(true) for itself.
	 -- See sample.Corners for example.
o Robots of class Robot no longer take damage from hitting a wall
o Robots of class AdvancedRobot take more damage from hitting a wall
o Added isMyFault() to HitRobotEvent
  -- returns true if you caused the event by moving toward the other robot
o Revamped robot to robot collisions:
  -- Your movement will be marked complete if you are moving toward the other robot
  -- You will not be stopped if you are moving away from the other robot
  -- Collisions now cause more damage, but are easier to escape from
  -- This means robots without onHitRobot handlers still have a chance...
  -- An event is generated every time one robot hits another
    -- If you are moving toward the other robot, you will get onHitRobotEvent with isMyFault() = true
	-- If another robot is moving toward you, you will get an onHitRobotEvent with isMyFault() = false
	-- If you are moving toward each other, you will get two events, with the isMyFault() = true, first.
o Damage from robot to robot collisions is now a constant 0.4
o Added getBearing() to onHitByBullet
o Added a Bullet object
  -- encapsulates owner, victim, power, velocity, X, and Y.
o Bullet hitting bullet generates BulletHitBulletEvent
  - methods include getBullet() and getHitBullet()
o added getBullet() to HitByBulletEvent, BulletHitEvent, BulletMissedEvent
o Added fireBullet(), which is exactly like fire(), but returns a Bullet object
  -- I could not simply add a bullet return to fire, because it broke *all* existing robot .class files.
o You can now select from the results dialog
o Fixed path for open/save battles on non-Windows systems
o Fixed slashscreen for some systems
o Fixed minor api doc bugs
o Updated many api docs
o Renamed and reorganized many internal classes
o Fixed bug with allowed package names (now allows digits)
o Windows installer now defaults to c:\
o added getGunHeat() to Robot
  -- when gunHeat is 0, you can fire.
  -- gunHeat goes up by (1 + firePower / 5) when you fire.
    -- this is unchanged from the v0.95
o added getGunCoolingRate() to Robot
o deprecated getGunCharge()
  -- use getGunHeat()
o deprecated endTurn()
  -- It will still work for now, but you should replace calls to to it with execute().
o Removed onSkippedTurn
  -- your robot will simply be stopped instead.
  -- The results dialog will report "not deterministic"
  -- Not deterministic means that a battle started with the exact same conditions
     and starting positions, may not end up with the same results.
	 (Ok, so far, you can't test that...) :)
  -- Added getWaitCount() and getMaxWaitCount() to AdvancedRobot.
o deprecated SkippedTurnEvent
  -- well, it's no longer used.
o deprecated all getRobotXXX methods
  -- replaced with getXXX methods.
o deprecated all getXXXDegrees and setXXXDegrees methods
  -- just use the getXXX and setXXX methods
o Compiler will always show output, and uses the -deprecation flag
  -- so you can see that you're using a deprecated call
  -- I would like to remove all deprecated calls in the next version
o Known bug:  New battle dialog not smart enough to differentiate between Robots classes and other classes 
  -- You will be able to put other classes into a battle
  -- They will sit there and do nothing

Version 0.95
(9/9/2001)
"The /. release"
------------
o Completely rewrote all windows and dialogs to use LayoutManagers
o Linux support vastly improved (although fps still not great)
o Improved framerate calculation (should be smoother on most systems)
o Robot exceptions now all go to robot's console
o Fixed bug in initialization - radar turn

o Known bug:  Linux version does not run well

Version 0.93
(4/23/2001)
------------
o Completely redone graphics for tanks, guns, radar
o Firepower adjusted.  Higher-power bullets now move slightly slower and fire slightly slower.

o Added execute() method for AdvancedRobots.  Better name for 'endTurn'.
o Optimized drawing of explosion graphics
o Added buttons for selecting battle size
o Bullets can now hit each other (not perfect yet)
o Updated security manager to work with jdk1.4

o Optimized scanning code
o Added 'color mask' to determine which parts of image should be recolored
o Replaced splashscreen and icons
o Java-based help, api, check new version.
o Robot menu (disabled)

o Fixed bugs in Tracker sample robot
o Fixed display issues with view scan arc option

Version 0.9
(3/2001)
-----------
o Completely reworked scan() to use a sweep as the radar moves.  If the radar is not moving, the scan will be a straight line.
o Added fire assistance to regular Robot classes (not AdvancedRobots).  If you fire at a robot you see during scan(), and gun/radar are 
  together, and you fire() before doing anything else, you will fire at its center.

Version 0.8
(2/2001)
-----------
o Initial release
  -- Robocode brought to IBM

Version 0.1
(9/2000)
