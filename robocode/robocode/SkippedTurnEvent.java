/**
 * A SkippedTurnEvent is sent to {@link AdvancedRobot#onSkippedTurn(SkippedTurnEvent)
 * onSkippedTurn()} when your robot is forced to skipping a turn.
 * You must take an action every turn in order to participate in the game.
 * For example,
 * <pre>
 *    try {
 *        Thread.sleep(1000);
 *    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 *        // Immediately reasserts the exception by interrupting the caller thread
 *        // itself.
 *        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * will cause many SkippedTurnEvents, because you are not responding to the game.
 * If you receive 30 SkippedTurnEvents, you will be removed from the round.
 * <p/>
 * Instead, you should do something such as:
 * <pre>
 *     for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
 *         doNothing(); // or perhaps scan();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * This event may also be generated if you are simply doing too much processing
 * between actions, that is using too much processing power for the calculations
 * etc. in your robot.
