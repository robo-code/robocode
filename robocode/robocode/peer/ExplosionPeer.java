 *     Flemming N. Larsen
 *     - Code cleanup
 *     - Added constructor for the BulletPeer in order to support replay feature
 *     - Fixed synchronization issue with update()
 *     - Replaced getting the number of explosion frames from image manager with
 *       integer constant
 *     - Added getExplosionLength() that overrides the one at the super class
 *     - Changed so that the update() method is no longer removing the bullet
 *       from the battle field, which is now handled by updateBulletState()
 *     Titus Chen
 *     - Bugfix: Added Battle parameter to the constructor that takes a
 *       BulletRecord as parameter due to a NullPointerException that was raised
 *       as the battleField variable was not intialized
