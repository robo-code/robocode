	 * This method is called every turn in a battle round in order to provide
	 * the robot status as a complete snapshot of the robot's current state at
	 * that specific time.
	 * <p/>
	 * The main benefit of this method is that you'll automatically receive all
	 * current data values of the robot like e.g. the x and y coordinate,
	 * heading, gun heat etc., which are grouped into the exact same time/turn.
	 * <p/>
	 * This is the only way to map the robots data values to a specific time.
	 * For example, it is not possible to determine the exact time of the
	 * robot's heading by calling first calling {@link Robot#getTime()} and then
	 * {@link Robot#getHeading()} afterwards, as the time <em>might</em> change
	 * after between the {@link Robot#getTime()} and {@link Robot#getHeading()}
	 * call.

	 * robot's radar scan "hits" another robot.
	 * You should override it in your robot if you want to be informed of this
	 * event. (Almost all robots should override this!)
	 * <p/>
	 * This event is automatically called if there is a robot in range of your
	 * radar.
	 * <p/>
	 * Note that the robot's radar can only see robot within the range defined
	 * by {@link Rules#RADAR_SCAN_RADIUS} (1200 pixels).
	 * <p/>
	 * Also not that the bearing of the scanned robot is relative to your
	 * robot's heading.
	 * <p/>
	 * Example:
	 * <pre>
	 *   void onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent event) {
	 *       // Assuming radar and gun are aligned...
	 *       if (event.getDistance() < 100) {
	 *           fire(3);
	 *       } else {
	 *           fire(1);
	 *       }
	 *   }
	 * </pre>
	 * <p/>
	 * <b>Note:</b><br>
	 * The game assists Robots in firing, as follows:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>If the gun and radar are aligned (and were aligned last turn),
	 * <li>and the event is current,
	 * <li>and you call fire() before taking any other actions, {@link
	 * Robot#fire(double) fire()} will fire directly at the robot.
	 * </ul>
	 * <p/>
	 * In essence, this means that if you can see a robot, and it doesn't move,
	 * then fire will hit it.
	 * <p/>
	 * AdvancedRobots will NOT be assisted in this manner, and are expected to
	 * examine the event to determine if {@link Robot#fire(double) fire()} would
	 * hit. (i.e. you are spinning your gun around, but by the time you get the
	 * event, your gun is 5 degrees past the robot).
